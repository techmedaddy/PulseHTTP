# PulseHTTP

PulseHTTP is a scalable, token-based authentication and role-based authorization Node.js application built with Express and MongoDB. The project is designed for user management (registration, login) with a strong focus on security, error handling, and industry best practices. PulseHTTP is fully Dockerized for easy deployment and structured to meet production-level standards.

## Project Overview

PulseHTTP is a backend application built to handle user management efficiently. It uses **token-based authentication (JWT)** to secure API endpoints and **role-based authorization** to control access. This ensures that users can only access resources they are authorized for.

The project focuses on:
- Security
- Scalability
- Modular architecture
- Production-ready features

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Handles secure user registration and login with encrypted passwords.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Implements roles (e.g., admin, user) to control access to different API routes.
- **Middleware Integration**: For authentication, authorization, and error handling.
- **Secure Routes**: Routes protected using authentication middleware.
- **Dockerized**: Fully Dockerized for simple and consistent deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Token-based authentication
- **Docker**: Containerization of the app for easy deployment
- **bcrypt.js**: Password encryption
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management
